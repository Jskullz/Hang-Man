**Hangman Game ReadMe**

**Description:**
This Python script implements a simple Hangman game where the player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word. The game provides a visual representation of the Hangman's gallows and a set number of chances (lives) to guess the word correctly.

**How to Play:**
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The game will display the Hangman logo and initialize the gameplay.
3. You will be prompted to guess a letter.
4. Enter a lowercase letter as your guess and press Enter.
5. If your guess is correct, the corresponding letter(s) will be revealed in the word.
6. If your guess is incorrect, you will lose a life, and a portion of the Hangman's figure will be displayed.
7. You continue guessing until you either uncover the entire word or run out of lives.
8. If you uncover the entire word, you win the game. If you run out of lives, you lose the game.

**Additional Notes:**
- The script selects a random word from a predefined list for each game session.
- You have six lives (represented by the Hangman's figure). If you make six incorrect guesses, you lose the game.
- The Hangman figure is displayed using ASCII art in different stages of completion.
- Duplicate guesses are not penalized, but repeated guesses of the same letter are indicated.
- The script provides feedback on the progress of the game, indicating whether you win or lose.

**Customization:**
- You can modify the word list to include your own words or themes.
- ASCII art for the Hangman figure can be customized or replaced according to your preferences.

Enjoy playing the Hangman game and have fun guessing the words! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact the developer.
